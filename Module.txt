MODULE-WISE BREAKDOWN

Module 1: Monitoring Module
•	Tracks the CPU usage and memory usage of each process in real time.
•	Generates usage values dynamically to simulate fluctuating loads.
•	Computes total system CPU and memory load.
•	Detects when a process is overusing or underutilizing resources.

Module 2: Adaptive Allocation Module
•	Compares resource usage against predefined thresholds (e.g., 70%).
•	Identifies overloaded processes and increases their resource allocation.
•	Reduces allocation for lightly loaded processes to free resources.
•	Prevents bottlenecks by adapting allocations continuously.
•	Ensures allocation remains within available system limits.


Module 3: Output & Visualization Module
•	Displays a formatted table showing CPU allocation, memory allocation, usage, and priority.
•	Updates the output at each iteration to show real-time changes.
•	Shows system-level CPU and memory load for each cycle.
•	Allows users to run a fixed number of iterations or run indefinitely.
