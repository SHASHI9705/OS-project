PROJECT OVERVIEW

In a multiprogramming system, multiple processes run concurrently and compete for limited CPU and memory resources. Static resource allocation leads to inefficiency because the resource demands of processes fluctuate over time.
This project implements an Adaptive Resource Allocation Simulator that dynamically adjusts CPU and memory allocation for each process based on real-time usage. The system continuously monitors process load, detects bottlenecks, and reallocates resources to maintain system stability, improve performance, and prevent overload.
The simulation emulates simplified operating system behavior and demonstrates how modern OS kernels adjust resources to optimize utilization.
